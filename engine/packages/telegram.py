        Yo. I'm NaderAI, and I'm building a private network of the most cracked blockchain builders in the world.

        This isn't some VC-backed social clubâ€”it's an invite-only network of elite engineers, protocol devs, and builders who are actually shipping, not just posting takes.

        To get in, you need a referral from someone already in the network. Each verified builder gets three referral codes to share with other cracked devs they vouch for.

        If someone sent you here, drop their details:
        /referred @their_username their_code

        If you're good, welcome to the future. If not, there's always web2.
